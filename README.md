## Description
Anything needed here that the subheading doesn't already cover?

## Gratitude
With the encouragement of friend in Brooklyn as well as early beta testers, commenters on Twitter, I felt inspired to make this tiny, convenient app native. The [first iteration](https://github.com/jbobrow/MTA-Subway-Now-Departing/tree/main) of this was made possible 2 years ago as a widget for my iPhone because of the incredible App/tool [Scriptable](https://scriptable.app/). Scriptable is by far the quickest way I've ever designed and developed an app for the iPhone and the very first widget I ever made. The MTA does a nice job of making the Subway times available via an API, but even nicer is @jonthornton's [MTAPI](https://github.com/jonthornton/MTAPI?tab=readme-ov-file) which converts it to an even easier JSON format. In addition to the many indie developers that inspire me to make something elegant, useful, fun, beautiful... every day, -perhaps I should place a nice list here- I am grateful for my partner who gifted me the Apple watch this year for the holidays, giving me an incredibly selfish reason to make this project real. 

## Development notes
Co-developed w/ ChatGPT. While this is not the first time I've worked in Xcode or with apple technology, it is the first time I've made a WatchOS app, used SwiftUI, or really any of the simple, yet still neat things this app does. [Here](https://chatgpt.com/share/6779f476-95ac-8012-8db2-d53c35c28703) is what the conversation with ChatGPT looks like, picking up from my very first conversation that helped me start with a simple grid of icons based on my figma mockup.
